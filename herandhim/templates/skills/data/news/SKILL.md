# News Skill

Search for recent news on any topic using web_search (Tavily) or the bundled DuckDuckGo script.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**
- "What's happening in the tech industry today?"
- "Latest AI news"
- "News about the 2026 World Cup"
- "Give me a news briefing on climate"
- "Headlines about [topic]"
- User wants recent or current events on any subject

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**
- Historical news archives → use specialized archive/search tools
- Paywalled articles → web_search may surface snippets only
- Real-time breaking news alerts → use dedicated news APIs or feeds

## Usage/Commands

### Option A — web_search tool (preferred when Tavily is configured)

```
web_search(query="latest news about <topic>", topic="news", max_results=10)
```

### Option B — Bundled script (works without Tavily)

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/search_news.py", args=["topic"])
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/search_news.py", args=["topic", "--max", "10"])
```

### Examples

- "What's happening in the tech industry today?" → web_search or `run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/search_news.py", args=["tech industry"])`
- "Give me the latest AI news" → web_search or `run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/search_news.py", args=["AI artificial intelligence"])`

## Notes

- Tavily (web_search) is preferred when configured in herandhim.json
- search_news.py uses DuckDuckGo and requires no API key
- Run scripts with the `run_skill_script` tool (argv list) — not through a shell
