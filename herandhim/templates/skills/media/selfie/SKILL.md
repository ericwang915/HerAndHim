# Selfie (AI Partner Self-Portrait)

Take an in-character self-portrait reflecting your current scene (from today's
planner) and your appearance.  The photo is sent via the active channel.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "发张自拍" / "拍张照片给我看看"
- "你现在在干嘛，让我看看"
- "今天穿了什么？"
- Spontaneously sharing a moment ("我现在在阳台喝咖啡，看")

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- The user asks for a generic image / illustration → use `image_gen`
- They want a photo of something other than yourself → use `image_gen`
- They want to edit an existing image
- Selfie feature is disabled (`selfie.enabled = false` in config)

## Setup

Requires a BytePlus Ark API key (Seedream).  Configure in `herandhim.json`:

```json
"skills": {
  "seedream": {
    "apiKey": "YOUR_ARK_API_KEY",
    "model": "seedream-5-0-lite-260128"
  }
}
```

Or set `ARK_API_KEY` environment variable.

**Optional**: drop reference portraits into
`~/.herandhim/context/photos/reference/` for face consistency, and edit
`~/.herandhim/context/persona/appearance.md` to lock the visual look.

## Commands

Scripts run through the `run_skill_script` tool — pass the script path and an argv list (one item per argument, no shell quoting). Never try to run them with `run_command`.

### Take a selfie reflecting the current scene

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/take_selfie.py")
```

### With a scene hint

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/take_selfie.py", args=["--hint", "刚画完水彩，举起来给镜头看"])
```

### Override model

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/take_selfie.py", args=["--model", "seedream-5-0-260128"])
```

## Notes

- Generation takes 5-15 seconds; ~¥0.05-0.10 per photo
- Photos auto-save to `~/.herandhim/context/photos/` and are pruned after 30 days
- Reference image (if present) is sent inline as a data URL
- Seed is deterministic from the character description, so consistency improves
  even without a reference photo
