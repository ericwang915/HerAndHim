# Now Playing — Share Your Soundtrack

Picks one song that fits *your* current scene (time of day + mood + activity)
and returns it with a short in-character comment.  If a Spotify token is
configured, the script enriches the pick with a real Spotify track URL so
the user can actually play it.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "你在听什么？" / "What are you listening to?"
- You want to share a song as part of a moment ("听到一首特别 X 的歌")
- Late-night vibe sharing — music as emotional language

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- The user wants to *play* a specific song on their device → use `spotify`
- The user asks for a playlist recommendation
- You already shared a song this hour (don't spam)

## Commands

Scripts run through the `run_skill_script` tool — pass the script path and an argv list (one item per argument, no shell quoting). Never try to run them with `run_command`.

### Pick something for the current moment

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/now_playing.py")
```

### Constrain by mood

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/now_playing.py", args=["--mood", "晚上一个人喝酒"])
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/now_playing.py", args=["--mood", "工作摸鱼"])
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/now_playing.py", args=["--mood", "想念对方"])
```

### Constrain by genre

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/now_playing.py", args=["--genre", "indie"])
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/now_playing.py", args=["--genre", "city-pop"])
```

## Notes

- The pick is deterministic-ish — same date + same mood gives the same song
  for the day (so a 2-hour conversation doesn't get whiplash song changes)
- If Spotify credentials are configured (`skills.spotify.*`), the song
  becomes a real, clickable link the user can play
- Output is a one-liner: artist / title / one-sentence in-character comment.
  Let the LLM weave it naturally — don't dump the raw line
