# Session Logs

Search your complete conversation history stored in session Markdown files.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "What did we talk about yesterday?"
- "Find the conversation where I asked about X"
- "How many sessions have I had?"
- "What was the decision we made about Y?"
- User references a past conversation not in current context

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- Current session context → already in your message history
- Application error logs → use `read_file` on log files directly
- Non-HerAndHim logs → use `run_command` with grep/rg

## Session File Location

Session files are stored under `~/.herandhim/context/sessions/`.

Each session is a Markdown file named `<session_id>.md` containing the full
conversation transcript.

## Commands

The bundled script runs through `run_skill_script`. The `ls` / `grep` / `cat`
alternatives below need the `run_command` shell tool, which is off on
network-exposed installs — prefer the script.

### List all sessions by date and size

```bash
ls -lhS ~/.herandhim/context/sessions/*.md
```

### Search across ALL sessions for a keyword

```
run_skill_script(script="{skill_path}/search_sessions.py", args=["keyword"])
```

Or with grep:

```bash
grep -rl "keyword" ~/.herandhim/context/sessions/*.md
```

### Read a specific session

```bash
cat ~/.herandhim/context/sessions/<session_id>.md
```

### Count sessions

```bash
ls ~/.herandhim/context/sessions/*.md | wc -l
```

## Notes

- Session files are append-only Markdown
- Large sessions can be several hundred KB — use `head`/`tail` for sampling
- Session IDs follow the pattern `<channel>_<id>` (e.g. `telegram_123456`, `web_default`)
- The `history_detail.jsonl` file contains structured tool-call logs
